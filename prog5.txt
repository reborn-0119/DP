Data privacy laws specify how data should be collected, stored, 
and shared with third parties. The most widely discussed 
data privacy laws include:

GDPR: The European Unionâ€™s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
is the most comprehensive data privacy law in effect. It applies to 
European Union citizens and all companies that do business with them, 
including countries not based in Europe. GDPR gives individuals the 
right to determine what data organizations store, request that 
organizations delete their data, and receive notifications of data 
breaches. Noncompliance may result in hefty fines and legal action.

CCPA: The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) is a state-level 
regulation in the United States. It enables California residents to 
ask organizations what personal data exists about them, delete it 
on request, and find out what data has been given to third parties. 
These measures apply to consumer data gathered within the state.
